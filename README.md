App Description (40-50) words

Many people who suffer from mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety keep these things to themselves. What our app does is allow people who are suffering from these mental states to find ways to combat them ranging from other websites to finding people to discuss with. We plan to create a safe space in which people can feel comfortable sharing their difficulties with others. This will be done by creating a chatspace to discuss the problems people are having. As well as other pages for general remedies and a way to communicate with people who can relate to them, and find solutions that worked for other people and may work for them.
